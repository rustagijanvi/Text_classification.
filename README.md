# Welcome to the "Text Classification" project.
This repository hosts a powerful text classification system designed to categorize text documents into one of 20 distinct news groups given in the following Dataset - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Twenty+Newsgroups .. With each news group represented as a separate folder, containing up to 1000 sub-text files, this project offers a robust solution for organizing and analyzing large volumes of textual data.

# Key Features:
Multi-class Text Classification: Efficiently classify text documents into 20 predefined news categories.
Scalability: Handle vast amounts of data with ease, accommodating up to 1000 sub-text files per news group.
Machine Learning Models: Employ state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to achieve accurate classification results.
Comparision : compare accuracy with self implemented Naive Baye's and already implemented MultinomialNB classifier in sklearn.
Evaluation Metrics: Assess model accuracy and performance using various evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
